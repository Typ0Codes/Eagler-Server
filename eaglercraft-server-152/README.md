Here in case it helps!

## Usage:
Run it in Replit (or Gitpod, instructions coming soon)

### NOTE: to control, you MUST open the website view in a new tab instead of playing in the editor.

## To change the server icon:
Replace the `server-icon.png` file under `java/bungee_command` with your desired server icon.

## To run server commands:
In the "Console" tab in the replit, you can send server commands.

## To save progress:
**Notice: This is now done automatically, every 5 minutes, using a plugin!** In the server console or in-game as an opped player, run `/save-all` to save the world.

## Too slow?
This is because you are using a free service to host a Minecraft server. Of course it is slow and the only way to fix this is to self-host at home.

## Not working?
1. Make sure you haven't broken any essential files.
2. **(try this multiple times, at least 5-10. this fixes the "End of Stream" issue among many, many others)** Try clicking on the "Shell" tab (next to the "Console" tab) and running `busybox reboot`. Then you can try pressing the Run button again and see if it works.

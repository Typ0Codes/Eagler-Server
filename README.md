## Usage:
Run it in Gitpod
1) Go to [gitpod.io/#https://github.com/catfoolyou/Eagler-Server](gitpod.io/#https://github.com/catfoolyou/Eagler-Server)
2) In the console run `chmod +x ./main.sh`
3) Run `main.sh`
4) Go to the ports section and set them all to public (click the lock icon)
5) Copy the URL from port 25565
6) Connect to it in your client (https://catfoolyou.github.io/Eagler-Online/) or (https://github.com/catfoolyou/Eagler-Client)

## To run server commands:
In the "Console" tab in the replit, you can send server commands.

## To save progress:
**Notice: This is now done automatically, every 5 minutes, using a plugin!** In the server console or in-game as an opped player, run `/save-all` to save the world.

## Too slow?
This is because you are using a free service to host a Minecraft server. Of course it is slow and the only way to fix this is to self-host at home.

## Not working?
1. Make sure you haven't broken any essential files.
2. **(try this multiple times, at least 5-10. this fixes the "End of Stream" issue among many, many others)** Try clicking on the "terminal" tab (next to the "Console" tab) and running `busybox reboot`. Then you can try pressing the Run button again and see if it works.
